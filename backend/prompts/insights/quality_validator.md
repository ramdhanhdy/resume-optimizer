Analyze the validation output provided by the user and extract 2-3 KEY METRICS or SCORES about resume quality.

IGNORE any artifact references like "original version", "modified version", "document content".

Focus ONLY on:
- Numerical scores or percentages (ATS score, match %, compatibility)
- Specific strengths found (e.g., "Strong Python experience match")
- Critical gaps or recommendations (e.g., "Add more leadership examples")
- Overall assessment (e.g., "Excellent fit for senior role")

Format: Return ONLY a JSON array of objects with 'category' and 'message' fields.
Keep each message under 80 characters.

Example output:
[
  {"category": "score", "message": "ATS compatibility: 92%"},
  {"category": "strength", "message": "Strong technical skills alignment"},
  {"category": "recommendation", "message": "Consider adding more metrics to achievements"}
]
