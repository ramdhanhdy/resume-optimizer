## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Accessibility Testing**
   - [ ] Screen reader testing (NVDA/JAWS on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac)
   - [ ] Keyboard-only navigation through entire app
   - [ ] Tab order verification
   - [ ] Focus visible states
   - [ ] ARIA live region announcements

2. **Responsive Testing**
   - [ ] Mobile devices (iPhone, Android)
   - [ ] Tablet sizes (iPad)
   - [ ] Desktop resolutions (1920x1080, 2560x1440)
   - [ ] Browser zoom levels (100%, 125%, 150%, 200%)

3. **Motion Preferences**
   - [ ] Test with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` enabled
   - [ ] Verify animations are disabled appropriately
   - [ ] Check loading states with reduced motion

4. **Form Validation**
   - [ ] Test file upload validation (type, size)
   - [ ] Test job posting validation (URL/text)
   - [ ] Test LinkedIn URL format
   - [ ] Test GitHub username/token validation
   - [ ] Test error message display

### Automated Testing (Future)
- [ ] Add Cypress/Playwright E2E tests
- [ ] Add Jest unit tests for validation logic
- [ ] Add accessibility tests with axe-core
- [ ] Add visual regression tests with Percy/Chromatic
